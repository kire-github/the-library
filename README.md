# The Library mod
Save the books you've read with the Study verb and reread them later. This is also persistent between saves, so you don't have to unlock a book multiple times.

> [!CAUTION]
> The mod currently does not work with Roost enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The mod is not available through the Steam Workshop.
